# OptionPricing

In this project, I try to implement an object oriented approach to Options Pricing. The idea is

- To encapsulate the key algorithms in a way that the code can be reused for various cases
- To seperate the interface from implementation so that future improvements in implementation don't break the interface
- To look at neat ways to achieve simplicity in code, hiding implementation details, so as to provide no chances for data corruption or unauthorized access.
